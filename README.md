# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

 This is a systematical application of creating high quality software system using the engineering principles,tools and methods

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

 Software engineering involves the use of scientific principles including mathematis principles eg statistic research to design,analize and implementation of softwares while SDLC is mainly involves with writing codes to solve specific problem

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

(a)Requirement-this is where you do research on what the user need and what the system will require to go to the next phase
(b)Design-this is where you decide on the methodology that you will apply if it will be agile or even waterfall.
(c)implemetation -as a developer you are in  step of coding or building the software as per the design specification.
(d)TESTING-this is where the developer is confirming the quality and the function of the the software if it is for sure doing what he/she intented the software to do .
(e)Diployement-the software after being created the project manager will deliver the software to customer for use.
(f)Maitenance-This is where incase the software needs to be updated to meet the need that has arose due to technology change or customer preference  to enhance function of the system.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?  

 Waterfal model is model that is done in a chronological order where one phace has to be done in order to to move on to the next step while Agile is where developer can handle one phase before finishing then move to another and this can be done with different developers
 Agile is more flexible to use than it is with waterfall 

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
  This is where software engineer does research to know what is required to make the process of software development becomes succefull this means the design,research,users preference and finance to make sure the project is completed .
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

 this being a way of dividing systems in the same software .this help is reducing cost when you want to update.
 Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

  (a)Unit testing-The testing of individual component of a software system
  (b)Integration testing-testing how different component in a software interact.
  (c)System testing-Testing the whole software system.
  (d)Acceptance testing-selecting few users and test the whole software with them to confirm if the software meets users need
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
This is a process of tracking and managing the changes that happens in sofware code eg GIT

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
 they are charge of the planning, scheduling, budgeting, execution, and delivery of software and web projects to the customers.  
 challenges faced by managers-fast growing of tech,creep in development,budgeting problems 
  
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? 
Software maintenance is modifying and updating of software after diployment
maintenace is crucial since it help to keep the software effective and up to date 

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

 weak cybersecurity measures ,poor qualit codes.bias
  to ensure ethical standards the engineer shoul use best coding language and tools

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
